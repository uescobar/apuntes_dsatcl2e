    "Data science has a very interactive and exploratoratory nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line provides a so-called *read-eval-print-loop* (REPL). Allows repeat commands and no need to compile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is very close to the filesystem.\n",

    "## The command line is augmenting \n",
    "\n",
    "The command line integrates well with other tecnologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can convert your code (Python or R scripts) into a reusable command-line tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The command line is scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "Everithing that you type manually on the command line can also be automated through scripts and tools. Rerun commands when data has changed, commands can be run at specific intervals, on a remote server, and in parallel on many chuncks of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The command line is extensible\n",
    "\n",
    "The command lines itself is language agnostic. New command line tools are produced everyday by the open source community.\n",
